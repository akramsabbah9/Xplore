**Project General Overview**

Xplore is a minimalist adventure game where the player traverses through multiple landscapes to reach the end goal. The player is to wander through different scenes and interact with objects to trigger portals or checkpoints to travel between scenes. The game is intended to be relaxing and aesthetically pleasing.

**Gameplay**

Xplore&#39;s gameplay consists of moving the player around a three-dimensional space, with first-person view. The player can use the keyboard to move forwards, backwards, left or right. They can adjust their view by moving the mouse.

**Level Design**

Checkpoints will be differently-colored or otherwise unique objects in the scene that the player must move to in order to progress. After reaching a level&#39;s checkpoint, the player will be moved to the next level, with different aesthetics and scenery.

_Monument Valley:_ landscape design, geometric minimalism and use of pastel colors

_Fire Watch:_ First-person, 3D exploration

**Technical Details and Advanced Topics**

Xplore will be written in tiny-graphics. We plan to implement **shadowing** to enhance landscape design, and **collision detection** to keep our player in the scene. The landscapes will be constructed using minimalistic geometric shapes and models. We may import models and textures from other modeling software to add visual complexity to a given scene.

**Projected Work Schedule**

Week 6:

- Make first-person &quot;camera&quot;
  - Implement motion (controlled using W-A-S-D keys)
  - Implement perspective (controlled with mouse)
- Research possibilities of importing more complex models

Week 7:

- Select design direction and color palette
- Construct 1st landscape

Week 8:

- Implement shadows
- Construct more scenes

Week 9:

- Implement collisions that trigger transitions between scenes

Week 10:

- Finish up and submit final product

**Next Steps for Refined Proposal**

- Detailed plan for each scene
- Mid-way demo (first scene)
